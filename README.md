# Social Network Post

Creating a design that would fit a social network.

## To Do

* Modularize elements: so far, the post is a whole and contains all the elements inside of it. ~The idea would be to use the Custom Elements API, creating a framework agnostic solution.~ Not giving up on the Custom Elements idea but Vue just came to my view. Perhaps I'll try to do it without a framework once I get more knowledge.
* Implement a database for the posts and comments: two hardcoded examples into the HTML. Moving to a JavaScript local database implementation like Lovefield.
* Improve design: why not?
