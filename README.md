# Social Network Post

Creating a design that would fit a social network.

## To Do

* Modularize elements: so far, the post is a whole and contains all the elements inside of it. The idea would be to use the Custom Elements API, creating a framework agnostic solution.
* Implement a database for the posts and comments: two hardcoded examples into the HTML. Moving to a JavaScript local database implementation like Lovefield.
* Improve design: why not?
